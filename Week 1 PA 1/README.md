# Goal
- Gain intuition for different notions of similarity and practice finding similar documents.
- Explore the tradeoffs with representing documents using raw word counts and TF-IDF
- Explore the behavior of different distance metrics by looking at the Wikipedia pages most similar to President Obama’s page.
# File Description
- `.zip` file is data file.
  - [people_wiki.csv.zip]() (unzip `people_wiki.csv`) consists of 59,071 pages and 3 features. URL name text
- `.json` files 
  - `people_wiki_map_index_to_word.json` 
- `.npz` files
  - `people_wiki_tf_idf.npz`
  - `people_wiki_word_count.npz`

# Snapshot
- **Recommend** open `md` file inside a file
- open `.html` file via brower for quick look.
# Algorithm
- K-NN with word count and tf-idf
- metrics differ from Euclidean and Cosine
